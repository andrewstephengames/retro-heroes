
Here will be 2 types:

1) Normal:

-the majority of moves are here, with different SP, you can change them if you want, as SP goes

-fr0m here each player will choose 3 moves

-for monster, idk, we can either make it choose randomly 3 moves, or give him the moves ourselves, like a basic NPC

2)Ultimates

-those are strong moves, that will go in the final election of moves

-only one move of this type!!!

->Now time for the Sp for each move:


->Normal:

-Slash: 15

-Heal: 15

-Shiled: 15

-Confusion: 20

-Buff Strength: 10

-Mega Heal: 5

-Fog: 20


->Ultimates:

-Mega Slash: 5

-Leech: 5

-Fire Ball: 5


Notes:

-I can do it only for my main simulation, but those things are to be done in the code with the Raylib:

->After a turn since it was activated, shield will automatically go down(hold it for just one turn)

->If a player is set on fire, he will permanently stay like that till the end of the game(look in the game comments to see how the move works)
